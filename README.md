This repository contains the "Base Board" for the modular robotic platform designed by me. Base board's main task is to be a breakout for the PCIe-based daughter boards (Drive Control, System Control etc). Base Board contains the USB hub, RJ45 ports and automotive connectors for the power distribution as well as separate power controls for 12V, 5V, 3V3 and 1V8 lines.
